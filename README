a program called symbol.cpp that opens up a window, and waits for the user to press a key or a mouse button. On each key or button press, it should display a small symbol centered at the current mouse location, as follows:

Left mouse click: Display a blue square outline, of side SIZE
Letter c: Display a white circle outline, or diameter SIZE
Letter t: Display a green isoceles triangle outline, of size compatible with the above (you may simplify the math here)
Numbers 3 through 9 (as char): Display a purple regular polygon with that many sides, inscribable in a circle of diameter SIZE 
e.g. 6 means a hexagon; use your trig knowledge here!
The ESC key (ascii 27): Clear the window.
Letter q: Quit the program.

* Note This program is dependent on the X11 API. It must be installed on the machine running.
